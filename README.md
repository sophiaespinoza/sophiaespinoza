- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @sophiaespinoza
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in physics and coding, more specifically in the area of astronomy. I am a physics major and will specialize in astrophysics.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning python and its applications to physics and astronomy.
- ðŸ’• I am using this space to share the codes of exercises and assignments sent to me by the teacher. 
      In the future I want to upload my own stuff but all this is a process that I want to document here, besides that someone may find it useful.
